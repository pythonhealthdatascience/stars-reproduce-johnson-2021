initially misunderstood this, and started troubleshooting, revisiting the installation instructions:\ndevtools::install_github('KateJohnson/epicR', ref=\"closed_cohort\")\nAnd how this fails because rredis has been removed from CRAN - hence, the method I had used instead, of loading the local folder as a package.\nERROR: dependency ‘rredis’ is not available for package ‘epicR’\n* removing ‘/home/amy/Documents/stars/stars-reproduce-johnson-2021/reproduction/renv/library/linux-ubuntu-jammy/R-4.4/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/epicR’\nWarning message:\nIn i.p(...) :\n  installation of package ‘/tmp/RtmpuwIUmF/file723a23834b02/epicR_1.27.7.tar.gz’ had non-zero exit status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nWorth being aware of this for an R package, that dependencies becoming unavailable can make this installation method impossible.\n\n\nHowever, I then realised my mistake, and revisiting the tables, recognised that actually:\n\nFor costs and QALYS, my results and the respository results were very similar (and both were very different from the paper for scenarios 2 and 3)\nFor ICER and INMB, my results were very different to the repository for all scenarios, which were in term very different to the paper (i.e. none match!)\n\nThis gives me assurance that I am getting the right results for costs and QALYs, but that likely there is a difference I hadn’t noticed.\nI then wondered if perhaps I were looking at the wrong table from the .md file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nHaving instructions in repository to guide me to the tables, or having labels in the .Rmd itself to say this was Table 3 and so on, would have been very helpful here, as it seems to be taking me a while to get my head around!\n\n\nThe Cost Effectiveness Plane table is “adjusted to the total population”. I made a .csv with the CEPlane from their .md and then modified Process_Model_Results.Rmd to use CEplane instead of sall.\nIn that table, you can see CostpAgentAll comes out lower than CostpAgent, for example, which matches up to paper, so I used those “All” columns.\nThis resolved the issue for costs and QALYS, which now both matched the paper:\n\npd.read_csv('tab3_compare_to_original.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nInterval\nCostpAgent_paper\nCostpAgentAll\nCostpAgentAll_repo\nCostMyDiff\nCostMyPerc\nCostRepoDiff\nCostRepoPerc\nQALYpAgent_paper\nQALYpAgentAll\nQALYpAgentAll_repo\nQALYMyDiff\nQALYMyPerc\nQALYRepoDiff\nQALYRepoPerc\nICER_paper\nICER\nICER_repo\nICERMyDiff\nICERMyPerc\nICERRepoDiff\nICERRepoPerc\nIncrementalNMB_paper\nINMB\nINMB_repo\nINMBMyDiff\nINMBMyPerc\nINMBRepoDiff\nINMBRepoPerc\n\n\n\n\n0\nS1a\n3 years\n2438\n2430\n2439\n8\n0.3%\n-1\n0.0%\n12.560\n12.558\n12.560\n0.002\n0.0%\n0.000\n0%\n19632\n13791\n18767\n5841\n42.4%\n865\n4.6%\n444\n703\n446\n-259\n-36.8%\n-2\n-0.40%\n\n\n1\nS1a\n5 years\n2356\n2355\n2355\n1\n0.0%\n1\n0.0%\n12.556\n12.560\n12.557\n-0.004\n0.0%\n-0.001\n0%\n19847\n9740\n17603\n10107\n103.8%\n2244\n12.7%\n312\n868\n411\n-556\n-64.1%\n-99\n-24.10%\n\n\n2\nS1b\n3 years\n2363\n2365\n2365\n-2\n-0.1%\n-2\n-0.1%\n12.554\n12.550\n12.552\n0.004\n0.0%\n0.002\n0%\n25894\n17035\n28168\n8859\n52.0%\n-2274\n-8.1%\n198\n386\n131\n-188\n-48.7%\n67\n51.10%\n\n\n3\nS1b\n5 years\n2296\n2311\n2298\n-15\n-0.6%\n-2\n-0.1%\n12.552\n12.554\n12.551\n-0.002\n0.0%\n0.001\n0%\n23187\n10380\n29091\n12807\n123.4%\n-5904\n-20.3%\n168\n637\n142\n-469\n-73.6%\n26\n18.30%\n\n\n4\nS1c\n3 years\n2386\n2398\n2386\n-12\n-0.5%\n0\n0.0%\n12.551\n12.552\n12.551\n-0.001\n0.0%\n0.000\n0%\n46956\n17438\n37782\n29518\n169.3%\n9174\n24.3%\n15\n433\n40\n-418\n-96.5%\n-25\n-62.50%\n\n\n5\nS1c\n5 years\n2313\n2300\n2311\n13\n0.6%\n2\n0.1%\n12.550\n12.544\n12.551\n0.006\n0.0%\n-0.001\n0%\n38673\n27839\n34119\n10834\n38.9%\n4554\n13.3%\n47\n142\n110\n-95\n-66.9%\n-63\n-57.30%\n\n\n6\nS2a\n3 years\n2286\n2284\n2287\n2\n0.1%\n-1\n0.0%\n12.553\n12.555\n12.552\n-0.002\n0.0%\n0.001\n0%\n18908\n7853\n21840\n11055\n140.8%\n-2932\n-13.4%\n223\n703\n186\n-480\n-68.3%\n37\n19.90%\n\n\n7\nS2a\n5 years\n2246\n2235\n2245\n11\n0.5%\n1\n0.0%\n12.551\n12.548\n12.550\n0.003\n0.0%\n0.001\n0%\n17514\n9106\n19840\n8408\n92.3%\n-2326\n-11.7%\n176\n418\n137\n-242\n-57.9%\n39\n28.50%\n\n\n8\nS3a\n3 years\n2234\n2220\n2232\n14\n0.6%\n2\n0.1%\n12.548\n12.551\n12.548\n-0.003\n0.0%\n0.000\n0%\n30366\n7930\n34146\n22436\n282.9%\n-3780\n-11.1%\n54\n556\n45\n-502\n-90.3%\n9\n20.00%\n\n\n9\nS3a\n5 years\n2207\n2218\n2207\n-11\n-0.5%\n0\n0.0%\n12.548\n12.537\n12.548\n0.011\n0.1%\n0.000\n0%\n22636\n-80780\n22117\n103416\n-128.0%\n519\n2.3%\n68\n-126\n67\n194\n-154.0%\n1\n1.50%\n\n\n10\nS3b\n3 years\n2292\n2273\n2289\n19\n0.8%\n3\n0.1%\n12.553\n12.550\n12.553\n0.003\n0.0%\n0.000\n0%\n18438\n14736\n19575\n3702\n25.1%\n-1137\n-5.8%\n241\n440\n243\n-199\n-45.2%\n-2\n-0.80%\n\n\n11\nS3b\n5 years\n2250\n2258\n2248\n-8\n-0.4%\n2\n0.1%\n12.552\n12.548\n12.551\n0.004\n0.0%\n0.001\n0%\n16251\n13430\n17541\n2821\n21.0%\n-1290\n-7.4%\n206\n366\n183\n-160\n-43.7%\n23\n12.60%\n\n\n12\nS3c\n3 years\n2256\n2233\n2255\n23\n1.0%\n1\n0.0%\n12.550\n12.545\n12.550\n0.005\n0.0%\n0.000\n0%\n23972\n14727\n21507\n9245\n62.8%\n2465\n11.5%\n114\n246\n148\n-132\n-53.7%\n-34\n-23.00%\n\n\n13\nS3c\n5 years\n2224\n2219\n2221\n5\n0.2%\n3\n0.1%\n12.549\n12.545\n12.549\n0.004\n0.0%\n0.000\n0%\n20278\n12968\n17870\n7310\n56.4%\n2408\n13.5%\n107\n251\n113\n-144\n-57.4%\n-6\n-5.30%\n\n\n14\nS3d\n3 years\n2263\n2241\n2261\n22\n1.0%\n2\n0.1%\n12.549\n12.545\n12.550\n0.004\n0.0%\n-0.001\n0%\n28245\n19458\n21157\n8787\n45.2%\n7088\n33.5%\n86\n230\n124\n-144\n-62.6%\n-38\n-30.60%\n\n\n15\nS3d\n5 years\n2227\n2222\n2226\n5\n0.2%\n1\n0.0%\n12.548\n12.539\n12.548\n0.009\n0.1%\n0.000\n0%\n27591\n-38068\n25402\n65659\n-172.5%\n2189\n8.6%\n62\n-42\n67\n104\n-247.6%\n-5\n-7.50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis aligns with the table 3 caption from paper about symptomatic patients (scenario 2) and smoking history (scenario 3):\n\n“The ‘All patients’ strategy encompassed the entire population of interest. 59% of the population was included in the ‘Symptomatic’ strategy, and 46% in the ‘Smoking history’ strategy. To maintain a constant reference population, per patient costs and QALYs were adjusted to include patients not selected by the strategy. For the symptomatic strategy, the costs (and QALYs) shown are the sum of the costs (QALYs) of patients not included in the symptomatic strategy, and the costs (QALYs) of those included, weighted by the proportion in each group. The results of smoking history strategy were adjusted in the same fashion” Johnson et al. (2021)"

I had a look at the original output of incrementalcosts and incrementalqaly in my .md file and the original, and realised that actually although the costs and qalys are very similar, it has a big impact on the ICER. Therefore, it seems this could be related to the number of agents."

    "text": "This repository is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView license\n\n\n\n\n\n                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nUse with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w' andshow c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.\n\n\n\nThis is aligned with the original study, who shared their code under the GNU General Public License version 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView license\n\n\n\n\n\n                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nUse with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w' andshow c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html.\n\n\n\nThe original study was published in the journal “Applied Health Economics and Health Policy”.

I haven’t identified any code in the GitHub repository to run this analysis. As such, I am assuming that the provided scripts were directly modified to run each of these scenarios.\nThe contents of each figure as presented below, along with my identified snippets of code that we would likely need to alter for the scenario.\nFigure 4 has INMB from:\n\nReference case analysis\nNo smoking cessation (smoking_adherence=0.7) (input$values$smoking$smoking_cessation_adherence &lt;- smoking_adherence)\n50% medication adherence (medication_adherence=0.7)\n30% medication adherence (medication_adherence=0.7)\n0.01 treatment utility (medication_utility=0.0367)\n0 treatment utility (medication_utility=0.0367)\n\nWhilst appendix 7 has INMB from:\n\nReference case analysis\n0% discount rate (discount_rate=0.015)\n3% discount rate (discount_rate=0.015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nIt’s handy that I could fairly easily identify each of these variables in the script since the variable names aligned pretty well with the concepts.\n\n\nWhilst there is a global variables section at the top of the script, they then seem to be provided each time at the start of each scenario in Case_Detection_Results.Rmd - but I think this is just because each scenario changes something slightly in the inputs, so they repeat them all each time.\nI would prefer not to duplicate the .Rmd files 8 times, so I started a Sensitivity_Analysis.Rmd file. I what differed between all the scenarios (in reference case, time intervals, and in sensitivity analysis).\nOn reflection, I think the simplest solution to this, instead of trying to restructure all the models to run easily from one file, would be to write a script that duplicates the Rmd file but alters one part of it."

I can see that casedetection/Case_Detection_Results.md has similar tables and figures to the scope (table 3, figure 3).\nThe README has an additional section titled Case Detection Analysis with instructions to perform the analysis. It suggests to install the branch as a package or to clone the repository, then copy the code from Case_Detection_results.Rmd and Case_Detection_Results_5yrs.Rmd, and knit it. It warns that the run time is about 16 hours for each script, and states that the analysis was conducted using R version 3.5.3.\nFollowing the procedure as I have done for previous R projects that I am reproducing, I will initially try to do so using the latest version of R and packages, and then attempt to backdate if there are issues.\nThere is a DESCRIPTION file with required packages for EPIC - since it uses that model, I’m assuming this to likewise be the basis for the environment for this reproduction. I created a DESCRIPTION file with the depends, packages and suggests from that, and used it to set-up renv, so:\n\nrenv::init(bare=TRUE)\nrenv::install() - but “Error: package ‘rredis’ is not available”\n\nOn CRAN page can see that the package was removed from CRAN and archived on 2022-03-21, but [can access archive] (https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rredis/).\nInstalled remotes - renv::install(\"remotes\")\nUsed that to install the latest version of rredis in the CRAN archive - remotes::install_version(\"rredis\", \"1.7.0\")\nAdd the installation of that version via remotes to DESCRIPTION\nDeleted current renv (so I could test that DESCRIPTION was set up correct with remotes).

The final three found the package, but then had error code 22.\nI then just did manual installation following the instructions provided (remotes::install_github('KateJohnson/epicR', ref=\"closed_cohort\")), which had error message that dependency rredis is not available. Hence, it seems I’ll need to just use it as a local package anyway.\nTried to figure the simplest way to install the package, whilst having a simpler folder layout. Figured the simplest might be to use devtools::load_all() to load a local folder as a package. I add devtools to DESCRIPTION then re-ran renv::install() and renv::snapshot().\nI copied the package into a folder, but amended its DESCRIPTION file so that rredis is installed using remotes. In the .Rmd file, I then devtools::load_all(\"./epicR\"). However, this had an error:\nRWarning: ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────── epicR conflicts\n──\n✖ `Cget_agent_events` masks `epicR::Cget_agent_events()`.\n✖ `Cget_all_events` masks `epicR::Cget_all_events()`.\n✖ `Cget_all_events_matrix` masks `epicR::Cget_all_events_matrix()`.\n  … and more.\nℹ Did you accidentally source a file rather than using `load_all()`?\n  Run `rm(list = c(\"Cget_agent_events\", \"Cget_all_events\",\n  \"Cget_all_events_matrix\", \"Cget_event\", \"Cget_events_by_type\",\n  \"Cget_inputs\", \"Cget_n_events\", \"Cget_output\", \"Cget_output_ex\",\n  \"Cget_runtime_stats\", \"Cget_settings\", \"Cget_smith\",\n  \"Cset_input_var\", \"Cset_settings_var\", \"get_sample_output\",\n  \"mvrnormArma\"))` to remove the conflicts.\nDespite that though, it seemed to have worked.\nI then add some additional dependencies from the .Rmd to DESCRIPTION and to the renv."

If I go to the commit prior to that, which was 17th November 2019, it is much less clear with no README instructions and the code for the study within the EpicR R/ directory.\nFeel I need to get a second opinion on what code to use for this study, due to the volume of commits, and the fact that they are prior to the issue date, but past the publication date."

This was despite having set the seed to 333, so it appears the seed control might not be working as expected, whether that be my fault for any changes or just in general.\nHowever, their latest results (from 50 million agents) still look quite different to the original, e.g. S1b 3yr ICER $31075/QALY in their repository versus $25,894/QALY in the paper.\nHence, I’m wary that running with 50 million agents on my machine - even if I could - still might not get me the same results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nUncertain on if seed control implemented properly. Also, here, it appears that either the number of agents can’t be reduced to get same results, and that a really high number are needed for stability, or that its actually just a seed issue."

This was very easy to get started with - just copying it over, but tweaking to add a grouping for 3 years and 5 years.\nI add the efficiency frontier based on the description in the text - looking for lowest cost-effectiveness ratio, and then ruling out strategies that were less effective with a higher ICER.

    "text": "11.24-12.15: Appendix 6\nAppendix 6 presents the clinical results from S1a 3 yrs. I couldn’t spot code for these figures in the closedcohort .Rmd files. I could see the package itself had plotting functions in figures.R and some of these appeared potentially relevant. This appeared to need to be called whilst running the model (rather than using the model outputs we had saved to csv).\nI made a new .Rmd file to run S1A, reduce from 1e6 to 50000 just while testing. Looking through the package, it wasn’t immediately clear to me how/when to call the export_figures() function. I tried adding it after all the S1A code. This had error:\nError in `cost_by_GOLD[, 2:5] &lt;- (op_ex$cumul_cost_gold_ctime[, 2:5])`:\n! number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length\nBacktrace:\n 1. epicR::export_figures()\nI tried instead putting it before s1a’s terminate_session(), but the error persisted.\nI tried a different approach, to instead manually copy of the relevant code from export_figures() so I can altered it more closely and figure out why its breaking. Looking at the function, it was running the model itself and using:\ndata &lt;- as.data.frame(Cget_all_events_matrix())\nop &lt;- Cget_output()\nop_ex &lt;- Cget_output_ex()\nI then realised that actually, the results we need might just be in the output S1.csv, and that these figures are more complicated than we require, so I instead looked to make them manually.\nThere are columns with Mild, Moderate, etc. counts but this needs to be transformed to per 1000. I wasn’t sure whether to:\n\nDivide by 1000 (as 1 million / 1000 = 1000)\nUse the “PY” results and multiply by 1000 (as that appears to be a bit like what they do in export_figures() although not super sure)\n\nEach of the two methods came out with different results. I searched in the repository but couldn’t find anything about MildPY or the others, so decided to go with the non-PY method, since I wasn’t actually sure what PY stood for, and whether it might actually be to do with “pack years” or “patient years”.\nDoing it manually, I made the first of the four figures, and found it actually looked very visually similar to the original, even if the number of exacerbations was lower. I suspected this was an issue with my adjustments. Looking at s1.csv, the Agents are actually lower than the base agents we set (apx 700k v.s. 1m). I tried using that to adjust - and that worked out much closer."

    "text": "13.30-14.42: Returning to appendix 6\nI created the four figures. For the fourth, the transformation I’d done to make it reflect 1000 didn’t seem to make sense for that one, but I wasn’t quite sure what the data was or how to transform it.\nI tried multiplifying by 1000, and that got results about half of the original. I tried multiplifying by 2000 - although this is just a total guess at this point.\nLooking across the results, I would say that I am satisified this matches the original for all except one bar: SABA. The SABA bars for patient years on treatment are much lower than in the original figure.\n\n\n\nAppendix 6 attempt\n\n\nSABA is one of the treatments: short-acting beta-agonists.\nI went to check my results, then realised there was an adjusted table of clinical results, and that I should try using that instead of S1, which is the more “raw” model results. Notably, that table just seems to have the columns used in the appendix plot - and they are adjusted to be per agent, so I can confidently just multiply by 1000 to get results for 1000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nIt’s great that this was provided, and makes it much easier. This is partly my fault for not noticing that I should be using that table. However, as for the other parts of this reproduction, this might have been supported by more guidance on which tables produced which figures, or inclusion of code to produce that figure in the paper. And, I wasn’t sure what to multiply for these either in the end (see below).\n\n\nI realised that multiplying by 1000 works with pAgent columns, but not for the pPYAll. It seems I’d need to multiply by about 16,000.\nI experimented with the others, but these were just guesses of what to multiply by, and I still found SABA results to be too low.\n\n\n\nAppendix 6 attempt 2"

Looking at Case_Detecetion_Results.Rmd, SABAAll was created as follows:\nProppPatientYears = ifelse(Scenario==\"S2a\" | Scenario==\"S2NoCD\" | Scenario==\"S3NoCD\" | Scenario==\"S3a\" | Scenario==\"S3b\" |\n                                       Scenario==\"S3c\" | Scenario==\"S3d\", PatientYears/sall[sall$Scenario==\"S1NoCDAvg\",\"PatientYears\"], 1),\n # SABA\nSABAExcluded = ifelse(Scenario==\"S1NoCDAvg\" | Scenario==\"S1a\" | Scenario==\"S1b\" | Scenario==\"S1c\", 0,\n                          ifelse(Scenario==\"S2a\" | Scenario==\"S2NoCD\", \n                                 (sall[sall$Scenario==\"S1NoCDAvg\",\"SABATotal\"]- sall[sall$Scenario==\"S2NoCD\",\"SABATotal\"])/\n                                 (sall[sall$Scenario==\"S1NoCDAvg\",\"PatientYears\"]- sall[sall$Scenario==\"S2NoCD\",\"PatientYears\"]),\n                          ifelse(Scenario==\"S3NoCD\" | Scenario==\"S3a\" | Scenario==\"S3b\" | Scenario==\"S3c\" | Scenario==\"S3d\", \n                                  (sall[sall$Scenario==\"S1NoCDAvg\",\"SABATotal\"]- sall[sall$Scenario==\"S3NoCD\",\"SABATotal\"])/                                                   (sall[sall$Scenario==\"S1NoCDAvg\",\"PatientYears\"]- sall[sall$Scenario==\"S3NoCD\",\"PatientYears\"]),999))),\n SABAAll = ProppPatientYears*SABA + (1-ProppPatientYears)*SABAExcluded,\nProppPatientYears adjusts the years for scenarios 2 and 3 by dividing them by the patient years of S1NoCDAvg. For scenario 1, it just sets this value to 1. This appears to be some adjustment of scenarios 2 and 3 so they compare against a single reference population. However, it remains unclear to me quite what the units are. SABAAll works out the same for scenarios 1 as SABA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nFound these transformations tricky to work out. I think part of the difficulty is that I’m really not quite sure what these columns are, and there isn’t documentation/comments to explain it, so I then don’t know how to transform them to match up with the paper.\n\n\nI then tried looking at the COPD DiagnosedpPY results, since those are the same thing just not broken down by treatment, and since clinical gives us adjusted versions of these but we also have “raw” versions from s1.\nclin_diag &lt;- clinical %&gt;%\n  filter(Scenario %in% c(\"S1NoCDAvg\", \"S1a\")) %&gt;%\n  select(Scenario, DiagnosedpPYAll)\n\ns1_diag &lt;- s1 %&gt;%\n  filter(Scenario %in% c(\"S1NoCDAvg\", \"S1a\")) %&gt;%\n  select(Scenario, Agents, DiagnosedPYs) %&gt;%\n  mutate(AdjDiagnosedPYs = DiagnosedPYs / (Agents/1000))\n\ndiag_investigate &lt;- merge(clin_diag, s1_diag) %&gt;%\n  mutate(AdjDivideByPYAll = AdjDiagnosedPYs / DiagnosedpPYAll)\n\nwrite.csv(diag_investigate, \"../../logbook/posts/2024_09_06/diag_investigate.csv\")\n\npd.read_csv('diag_investigate.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed: 0\nScenario\nDiagnosedpPYAll\nAgents\nDiagnosedPYs\nAdjDiagnosedPYs\nAdjDivideByPYAll\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nS1a\n0.462874\n743762\n659857.061426\n887.188457\n1916.696154\n\n\n1\n2\nS1NoCDAvg\n0.186304\n743240\n264401.460862\n355.741700\n1909.470132\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can convert between the two by multiplying by about 1910, but that doesn’t work for SABA.\nInstead, I tried looking back at export_figures() and the paper each again, but struggled to spot any answers there. I then tried looking at the first EpicR paper, “Development and Validation of the Evaluation Platform in COPD (EPIC): A Population-Based Outcomes Model of COPD for Canada”, but couldn’t find anything to explain it there either.\nI then looked to the main epicR repo, and found it has some documentation in the docs/ folder. I opened and read the html files in docs/articles/, but struggled to find answers here too."

And this looked pretty similar to 500,000 (5e5).\nLooking at Case_Detection_Results.Rmd, there are 12 scenarios, and then another 12 for 5 years, so a total of 24.\nI figured I could try running the whole thing with 500,000 to begin with, but up it to 1 million or 5 million if needed, but that 50 million probably wasn’t necessary (as anticipate will likely be able to get similar enough results with lower numbers)."
