## Time-to-completion

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time_to_complete import process_times, success_static, success_interactive

# List of time to complete each item
time_list = [
    [1124, 'Table 3'],
    [1124, 'Figure 3'],
    [1189, 'Figure 4'],
    [np.nan, 'Appendix 6'],
    [1157, 'Appendix 7']]
times_df = process_times(time_list)
```

Non-interactive plot:

```{python}
success_static(times_df)
```

Interactive plot:

```{python}
success_interactive(times_df)
```
