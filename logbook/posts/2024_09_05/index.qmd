## 09.28-09.38, 10.10-10.19: Running 5 years

Copied and modified `Case_Detection_Results_5yrs.Rmd` as I had for `Case_Detection_Results.Rmd` yesterday, and then ran that on the remote machine (8.6 minutes).

```
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('scripts/Case_Detection_Results_5yrs.Rmd')"
```

I've noted that the `CEplot-1.png` goes into a files/figure-gfm folder. I've add some code to change the default save location of images, moved the current images, and altered the section names.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Reflection

Duplication between the two .Rmd files - would be easier if both controlled by a single script that could make the two outputs, else when making changes like this, have to carefully make to both files.

## 10.20-11.30: Resuming Table 3

Add the 5 year results to Table 3 - still assuming that S0 is S1NoCD from 3 year (not from from 5 year or S2 or S3), as can't spot an S0 anywhere.

Due to size of table, it was difficult to just look between the two tables, so I converted and simplified Table 3 from the paper into a `.csv` file, and then appended that so I could calculate the differences.

Although some things are similar (e.g. scenario 1 costs and QALYs), others are very different...

```{python}
import pandas as pd

pd.read_csv('sall_compare_to_paper.csv')
```

## 11.32-X: Trying higher agent numbers

Curious is this is due to the number of base agents, I re-ran with 

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 371

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.28', '09.38'),
    ('10.10', '10.19'),
    ('10.20', '11.30')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
