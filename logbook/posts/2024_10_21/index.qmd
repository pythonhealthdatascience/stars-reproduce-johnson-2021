Following fix to med adherence, figure 4 now reproduced. Total reproduction time used: 19h 49m (49.5%).

## 09.20-09.27: Review sensitivity analysis following fix

Having fixed scenarios 2 and 3 (med adherence) and re-ran these, I re-generated the figures. This has absolutely resolved the issue, and we can now reasonably consider this figure reproduced. I got **consensus** on this from Tom, who agreed this is now similar enough to consider reproduced.

At this point, can now email the author, to let know success on most figures, and ask if any suggestions for the item we hadn't managed to reproduce.

## Timings for reproduction

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 1182

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.20', '09.27')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
