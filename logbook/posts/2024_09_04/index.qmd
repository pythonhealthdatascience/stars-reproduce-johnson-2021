## 09.19-X: Returning to run the model

Did a quick review of my prior logbook entries to get back up to speed. Will be trying to run `Mini_Analysis.Rmd`, which I had created previously and contains only scenario S1NoCD and saves the result to csv (whilst the full script `Case_Detection_Results.Rmd` contains many more scenarios. I had previously reduced the number of agents (`settings$n_base_agents <- `) to try and run on my local machine but this just returned 0/1/NaN, so I will now be trying with the full number of agents.

In `Case_Detection_Results.Rmd`, it sets `settings$n_base_agents <- 50e+6` but has comment "change number of agents here: 100e+6 is used in the analysis".

I initially tried to run `Mini_Analysis.Rmd` with 50e+6. I logged into the remote computer, cloned the GitHub repository

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 193

# Times from today
#times = [
#    ('', '')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
