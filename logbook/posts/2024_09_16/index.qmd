::: {.callout-note}

Ran final scenario analyses with 5e5, but as expected, not a match. Total time used: 17h 21m (43.3%)

## 09.23-09.25, 09.57: Running remaining scenarios with 5e5

Running Scenarios 6 and 7 with 5e5 base agents. Then ran my prepared `Process_Sensitivity_Analysis.Rmd`. As expected, these look very different from original, so will have to wait and see if running with 1 million base agents on the HPC resolves this issue or not.

## 09.59-10.00: Testing seeds

Ran one of them for a second time, just to confirm I got the same results, and that the seed control is working as expected - and this was indeed the case, with no changes in the results observed.

Try running one twice to check get same results each time

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 1035

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.23', '09.25'),
    ('09.54', '09.57'),
    ('09.59', '10.00')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
