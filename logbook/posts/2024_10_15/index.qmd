## 09.40-09.53: Reviewing results from 100 million agents

**Run times:**

* `Case_Detection_Results.md` - 20.65 hours - 20 hours 39 minutes
* `Case_Detection_Results_5yrs.md` - 20.67 hours - 20 hours 40 minutes

As these were run at the same time in seperate terminals, total was 20 hours 40 minutes.

**Model results:** Ran `Process_Model_Results.Rmd`. As expected, result still seems quite different for Appendix 6. For Table 3 and Figure 3, the results generally seem closer to the paper, and I would argue that I think these have been reproduced. I think this is a tricky case, as the ICER and INMB are evidently incredibly sensitive, and so with very similar looking QALYs and costs, they vary hugely. However, I am satisifed that we have now got close enough results to consider these reproduced.

## 09.54-X: Running sensitivity analysis with 100 million agents

Having found I needed to run this to 100 million agents, and given the timings were not exponentially larger (14 hours vs 20 hours), I set the sensitivity analyses to run with 100 million agents. I initially tried running all at once.
