## 09.15-09.20, 09.27-09.33: Review sensitivity analysis with 100 million

Ran `Process_Sensitivity_Analysis.Rmd`. These are changed to be much more similar to the original, and I feel reasonably similar enough to consider it reproduced, but will certainly need to discuss this, as there are obviously some differences too, so it feels - in this case - a very subjective decision!

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 1146

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.15', '09.20'),
    ('09.27', '09.33')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
