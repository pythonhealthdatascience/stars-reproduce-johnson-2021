## 09.31-09.38: Archive scope

I realised that I had forgotten to archive the repository between deciding on consensus scope and proceeding with the reproduction. However, I was easily able to resolve this by setting the release up a prior commit, and listing the date of that commit.

I created an annotated tag for that commit:

```
git tag v0.1.0 9146a68
git push origin v0.1.0
```

I could then open that tag on GitHub and select "Create release from tag".

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 1041

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.31', '09.38')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
