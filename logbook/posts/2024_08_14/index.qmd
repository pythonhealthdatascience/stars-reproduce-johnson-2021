## 09.27-09.52, 10.20-10.21: Run model

Helpfully, we know to expect that this has a long run time from their README:

> "Note: The analysis version of these results simulates 100 million agents, which will take ~16 hours to run for each script. The published analysis was conducted using R Version 3.5.3"

Given this warning, I tried running it with fewer agents:

```
settings$n_base_agents <- 5e+3
```

On my machine, I tried it with increasing numbers of agents, but it consistently returned results of 0 / 1 / NaN:

* 5000 (a  minute to run)
* 50,000 (2.4 minutes to run)
* 500,000 (18.2 minutes to run)

Unfortunately I can't currently access our remote higher spec machine, which would've allowed me to run these quicker.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 164

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.27', '09.52'),
    ('10.20', '10.21')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
