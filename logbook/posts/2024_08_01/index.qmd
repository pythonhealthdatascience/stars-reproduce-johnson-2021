## 09.44-09.48, 09.52-09.56: Upload journal article and artefacts

The article is published at <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40258-020-00616-2>. I could not identify a copyright statement, but it links to RightsLink to request permission to reuse content (which requires payment).

Found the article on ProQuest - <https://uoelibrary.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/cost-effectiveness-case-detection-strategies/docview/2493869343/se-2?accountid=10792> - which states copyright pringer Nature B.V. Mar 2021.

Also identified a conference abstract on the same topic <https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(20)31530-8/fulltext>.

As such, it appears I would not have permissions to upload this article or any images from the article to this repository. As I cannot identify a green open-access version of the article, I will just be able to include cited text quotations.

## 10.38-10.47: Consensus on upload of code

RE: my uncertainty yesterday as to uploading code with commits more recent than the publication date, I discussed this with Tom, and we agreed that I should take a similar approach to as we do when we make environments for projects without them: start with the latest version of the code, and then if things don't work, potentially go back in the commit history to help resolve it.

As such, I then uploaded a copy of the relevant branch of the repository to `original_study/`.

## Timings

```{python}
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from timings import calculate_times

# Minutes used prior to today
used_to_date = 0

# Times from today
times = [
    ('09.44', '09.48'),
    ('09.52', '09.56'),
    ('10.38', '10.47')]

calculate_times(used_to_date, times)
```
